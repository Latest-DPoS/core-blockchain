# Latest Chain

## Introduction to Latest Chain
Latest Chain (Latest) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high- performance transactions. The endogenous token of Latest is LTC and it adopts the DPoS consensus mechanism. Latest will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, Latest's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Latest is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Latest’s Performance
- TPS: 2000+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
DPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 500.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is LATEST; the transactions consume LATEST as gas fee.

Miners pledge LATEST to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to Latest by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Latest. 

Latest encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and Latest will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## Latest Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.
